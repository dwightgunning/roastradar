  Roast Radar aims to be a quick and easy way to locate specialty coffee roasters around the world.
</p>
<p>
  Why? I love to try out speciality coffee from local roasters whenever I'm travelling. I've found they're not always easy to identify via quick searches on Google Maps, usually made in a hurry from my mobile.
</p>
<p>
  So the idea here is to give quick and easy access to a curated set of roasters for easy reference, any time and any place.
