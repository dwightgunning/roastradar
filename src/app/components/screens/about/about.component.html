  Roast Radar aims to be a quick and easy way to find specialty coffee roasters that are nearby and (hopefully) open right now.
</p>
<p>
  Why? I love to try out specialty coffee from local roasters whenever I'm travelling. I've found they're not always easy to identify via quick searches with Google Maps on my mobile. It'd be way easier to pull out a dedicated list and go from there.

<p>
  So the idea here is to curate a reliable set of roasters and know they'll be close at hand whenever the need for caffeine should arise.
